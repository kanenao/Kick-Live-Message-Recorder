# Ollama AI article generation

This application can use a local Ollama server. No OpenAI API key is needed and article prompts are sent to the local machine's Ollama endpoint.

## Windows setup

1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download
2. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
3. Run:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
```

4. Keep Ollama running. Its default API address is `http://127.0.0.1:11434`.
5. Open the application's settings and test the Ollama connection.

## Privacy and fallback

- The default model is `qwen2.5:3b`.
- No API key or cloud AI account is required.
- If Ollama is unavailable or the selected model is missing, the application uses its existing non-AI article generation path.
- AI output is based only on recorded stream metadata and comments. It must not be treated as a verified transcript of the stream's audio/video.

## Hardware

The model is stored locally and uses the PC's RAM/CPU or supported GPU. Performance depends on available memory and hardware.


## Kick chat integration status

The current Kick beta does not yet capture or persist chat messages. The Ollama client and article generation service are prepared, but automatic article generation from live Kick chat requires the chat capture and storage feature to be completed first.
